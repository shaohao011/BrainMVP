Code for our CVPR 2025 paper [Multi-modal Vision Pre-training for Medical Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10604)

TL;DR

This work introduces BrainMVP, the first pre-training framework designed for large-scale missing modality medical imaging. We have made available the pre-training 16k mpMRI images and corresponding pretrained models.

We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 10 open-source segmentation and classification tasks. Feel free to use it to adapt to your own tasks!


## Abstract
Self-supervised learning has greatly facilitated medical image analysis by suppressing the training data requirement for real-world applications. Current paradigms predominantly rely on self-supervision within uni-modal image data, thereby neglecting the inter-modal correlations essential for effective learning of cross-modal image representations. This limitation is particularly significant for naturally grouped multi-modal data, e.g., multi-parametric MRI scans for a patient undergoing various functional imaging protocols in the same study. To bridge this gap, we conduct a novel multi-modal image pre-training with three proxy tasks to facilitate the learning of cross-modality representations and correlations using multi-modal brain MRI scans (over 2.4 million images in 16,022 scans of 3,755 patients), i.e., cross-modal image reconstruction, modality-aware contrastive learning, and modality template distillation. To demonstrate the generalizability of our pre-trained model, we conduct extensive experiments on various benchmarks with ten downstream tasks. The superior performance of our method is reported in comparison to state-of-the-art pre-training methods, with Dice Score improvement of 0.28\%-14.47\% across six segmentation benchmarks and a consistent accuracy boost of 0.65\%-18.07\% in four individual image classification tasks.
